:summary: How to protect your hands in winter

In order to keep your hands wounds free during the winter season you have to put on gloves during shower.

When you are using shampoing on your head your hands are being chafted by the soap. So before washing your hands make sure to use your latex gloves to wash everywhere on your body where soap is required. Then if you wish you may remove the gloves to wash your hands.
